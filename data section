I will use the shared dataset: https://s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/cf-courses-data/CognitiveClass/DP0701EN/version-2/Data-Collisions.csv
The data shows the relation between the severity code and the other factors like: the locatio, the road condition, accident descrebtion, the weather, the light condition,...etc.
